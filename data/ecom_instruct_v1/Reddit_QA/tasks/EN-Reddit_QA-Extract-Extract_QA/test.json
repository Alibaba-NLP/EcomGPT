{"trace_id": "5d9bdf908ae5305bc982e566", "sentences": "Context: Moderator fees. One of the novel aspects of OpenBazaar is the use of third party moderators who control one of the private keys of a 2-of-3 escrow multisig address. In the current framework, moderators only get involved personally with a transaction when a problem arises, which allows the funds in the address to be released (minus a moderator fee) either to the vendor or buyer. Moderators will play a critical role in the success of OpenBazaar, and I am curious what everyone thinks a moderator should charge. I suspect that there will be two types of fees: (1) a fee to release funds to the vendor when the buyer is unresponsive, and (2) a more expensive fee to resolve disputes between the buyer and seller.

I'm looking to go this route as I have Plex running on another docker, and don't want that to be under the VPN to avoid outside clients from having connection issues. 2) I've tried setting up the Deluge VPN docker, but I'm having trouble, in that after starting it up, I can't find the configuration file to add THE Open VPN config info.

Hi Everyone, My husband bought the condo we live in before we got married and lived together. He bought it at the height of the market (2005) in Woodbridge, VA for $290k and has a ARM loan with high interest rate (6.8%). He wasn't able to refinance because we didn't have the money to pay upfront to be able to refinance since our mortgage was from private lender and not a FHA/VA/Fannie/Freddie backed mortgage loan. We currently owe $255k on the loan. I am disabled veteran and want to see if we can use my va loan eligibility to refinance our home. Since the loan is currently only in his name, can we refinance it to a VA loan and pay out of pocket the difference between mortgage balance ($255k) to current zillow value (185k) to get into a VA loan product? I am open to any suggestions on how else we can work this to better our situation and get into a fixed interest rate mortgage loan and out of our ARM (6.8%) loan. If there is another way to work this without us having to come to the table with all of our savings, I would love to hear about different ideas. We were young when we bought the place and we didn't really understand what type of loan we got. Husband's credit is excellent (800+) and mine is average (680 - 700) with combined income of $150k. This time around we want to fully understand our options and weigh the pros/cons of each decision. Thank you for taking the time to respond and helping me understand the different scenarios / ideas.\nQuestion: What year was the height of the market that the condo was bought?", "label_set": [""], "spans": [{"term": "2005", "start": 259, "end": 263}]}

I've never posted here, but I'm hoping this question might work better here then say, something like askreddit (where frankly, I've never once got a answer to any question). Obviously, I'm pulling largely from movies or fictional novels, so I assume that the story perhaps might gloss over inherently greater health issues. What bothers me, though is that it often appears that in stories that reflect upon, let's say everything prior to the early 1900's you'll find people just up and dying from a flu or the common cold. Half the time in a book like Wuthering Heights or something, a character gets a fever and it's considered that the end is in sight. People often will say, oh, we have better medicine or hygiene, but as I currently have a very bad cold, one thing is clear: without any medical attention I will surely not being dying from this cold. So, it sparked the question in my mind. Why is it so often depicted that a person in say, 1830, gets sick and it's pretty much curtains for them. Now, again, obviously, there are other things to consider. I most likely won't need to go outside with the flu in frigid tempetures to feed livestock or be forced to travel by carriage into town to get food. I'm not likely to exacerbate the issue.

We all know that this deck prevents any kind of aggressive deck to beat tanky characters unless they pull off an unreal combo (which makes them win through combo, not through aggression). I suggest a slight change in the power of this card. Full heals without heavy pricing is generally a terrible idea. Fishing Trawler: Ally 3 Gold Heal all damage taken the previous chapter. +5 Armor. This change is sensible because you're not paying for an unbalanced full heal. This heal can be quite large and give a lot of value with the +5 armor, but it won't be as huge as the fishing trawler in its current state. Notice how it's also cheaper and is now a card against other control/combo decks because of the armor it gives. You're paying a lot for something that has a chance to not even occur if the enemy plays correctly. The 3 deck types and how they will be effected by this change. Aggro: This deck type will now require some more thought on when to push damage to the enemy, but it's now not GG when you get to Chapter 4 or 5. Combo: Fishing Trawler will have just a bit larger impact on combo decks. It prevents some OTKs through the +5 armor, but since it heals the previous turn's damage, just don't show your combos early and it will be pretty simple for combo decks to beat. Control: It will be a 3 mana +5 armor. Really bad, but at least it's still a usable card if you don't have anything to play. This card is an anti-aggro card anyways.

I played the game on and off for about six months, sometimes forgetting to even log in to claim my bonus - I missed around 7 to 8 days of login bonuses, so I should technically be at ~610 days today.
